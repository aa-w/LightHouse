## LightHouse

----------------------------------------------

LDR based light control for a mini house made as a gift - this program controls the brightness based on ambient light levels around the house - switching the lights on at night. The light circuit also includes animations and brightness variation for effect (controlled using a circular array rolling average).

The lights automatically turn off after 6 hours to reduce power consumption, turning back on again the next day.

Tapping the LDR 4 times with your finger will put the house into "disco mode"
